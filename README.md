I use Windows as my primary OS and Linux using WSL

On Windows I use a port of Suckless dwm for Windows called [dwm-win32](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/dwm-win32)

Basic Windows Programming Setup in my videos:

I use Windows 10

In my x86 Assembly videos I like using the NASM assembler.

## Common Questions

- Why I prefer using Windows over a Linux Distro as my main desktop OS? There are a couple of reasons:
  - I find it to be very user friendly, stable and nostalgic
  - I like the fact that it has wide support for old/new software and games
  - I like both Windows programming and Linux programming
  - I get great Linux support on Windows using WSL
  - I do like using Linux for my servers, but for desktop I find Windows to be best for me :)
