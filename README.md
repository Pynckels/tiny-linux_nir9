Useful information regarding my YouTube channel

- [Link to my .vimrc file](https://gist.github.com/nir9/3c59b8b5112484974e1f0541198388bd)

I use Windows as my primary OS and Linux using WSL (or sometimes through Dockers)

On Windows I use [LightWM](https://github.com/nir9/lightwm) which is a WIP open source tiling window manager I am working on.

Basic Windows Programming Setup in my videos:

I use Windows 10

- Visual Studio Build Tools
- Windows SDK
- Vim

Basic Linux Programming Setup in my videos:

I use Debian WSL in many of my videos

- gcc
- manpage-dev
- vim

## Common Questions

- Why I prefer using Windows over a Linux Distro as my main desktop OS? There are a couple of reasons:
  - I find it to be very user friendly, stable and nostalgic
  - I like the fact that it has wide support for old/new software and games
  - I like both Windows programming and Linux programming
  - I get great Linux support on Windows using WSL
  - I do like using Linux for my servers, but for desktop I find Windows to be best for me :)
 
- Why I prefer using Vim over other IDEs/Editors
  - I have some videos about this topic but to summarize:
    - Vim contains way more advanced, useful and awesome features than other IDEs and Editors and also exposes those features in a much more harmonic way as compared to IDEs which map advanced features to awkward keyboard chords. On my playlist "Vim Tips" I talk about some of those features I like and a lot of them cannot be found in other IDEs/Editors.

- Why I prefer using the command line build tools over graphical IDE buttons for building code
  - I prefer compiling and building in the command line instead of through IDE buttons since it lets me see and control exactly what is going on without the IDE abstractions, and it encourages me to understand how the compilation and linking works more deeply.
